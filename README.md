# World Model

My personal world model repository for organizing and connecting knowledge.

## About

This repository contains my personal knowledge base, organized in a way that helps me build a comprehensive "world model" - a framework for understanding how different pieces of information and concepts connect with each other.

## Structure

- `/tools` - Scripts and utilities to help manage and analyze the knowledge base
- `/notes` - Individual notes and documents
- `/concepts` - Core concepts that form the foundation of the world model
- `/connections` - Mappings and relationships between different concepts and areas of knowledge

## Usage

This repository is primarily maintained using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a powerful knowledge management tool that allows for creating and visualizing connections between different pieces of information.
