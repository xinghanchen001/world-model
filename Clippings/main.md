Lesson 2 of 66

## Welcome

AI has become the buzzword of today. Everyone talks about it, but few understand its true significance. There is a noticeable gap between AI's perceived importance and its practical benefits. This course aims to bridge that gap, especially in IT-related work. We'll address this from two angles: **what** scenarios where AI can help (the mindset) and **how** to use AI effectively (the expertise).

  

In this module, we will begin with AI-Assisted Programming, a superpower granted by the latest GenAI. Traditionally, programming has been the domain of developers, and it's undoubtedly very useful. Even for non-developer roles, programming can link different apps together, enabling actions like clicking a button ato collect data from Tableau, performing simple filtering, and updating relevant tickets in JIRA. Programming is not just a tool; it fosters a mindset of automation. This allows us to delegate repetitive tasks to computers, so we can focus on more important tasks that need our attention. One significant impact of GenAI is that with minimal training, anyone can gain access to this privilege quickly. This shift in mindset and expertise can fundamentally change how we work, making it an excellent starting point for learning how to boost productivity with GenAI.
