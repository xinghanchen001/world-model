# Project Guide for AI Assistance

This file was automatically generated by Claude Code to help AI assistants understand this project.

## Project Overview

This is a Claude Code prototype, demonstrating how an agentic AI coding assistant operates in the terminal. The project is structured as a Node.js CLI application that simulates the behavior of Claude Code.

## Key Components

- **index.js**: The main entry point that implements the CLI interface
- **package.json**: Project configuration and metadata
- **README.md**: Documentation for human users

## Architecture Patterns

This project follows a simple CLI application architecture:

- Command line input processing
- Command interpretation and execution
- Response formatting and display

## Development Workflow

1. Make changes to the code
2. Test by running `npm start` or `node index.js`
3. For distribution, use `npm link` to create a global symlink

## AI-Specific Guidance

When adding new features to this project, consider:

1. **New Commands**: Add entries to the `responses` object in index.js
2. **Command Processing Logic**: Extend the `processCommand` function
3. **UI Improvements**: Modify the console output formatting in the event listeners

## Common Questions and Answers

**Q: How do I add a new command?**  
A: Add a new key-value pair to the `responses` object in index.js, or add a new condition in the `processCommand` function.

**Q: How does the CLI interface work?**  
A: The application uses Node.js's readline module to create an interactive CLI interface that processes user input and displays responses.
