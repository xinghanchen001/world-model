# Claude Code Prototype

This is a prototype demonstrating how Claude Code works based on the research document. Claude Code is an agentic coding tool developed by Anthropic that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster through natural language commands.

## Installation

In a real-world scenario, Claude Code would be installed using:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

For this prototype, we're simulating the behavior with:

```bash
npm install
npm link
```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using Claude Code by running:

```bash
claude
```

This will start an interactive session where you can type natural language commands.

### Example Commands

```bash
# Get a high-level overview of the codebase
> give me an overview of this codebase

# Initialize a project with AI-friendly documentation
> /init

# Explore and understand specific components
> explain the main architecture patterns used here
> what are the key data models?
> how is authentication handled?

# Execute and analyze code
> run tests for the auth module and analyze any failures

# Modify and verify
> refactor the logger to use the new API
> run the tests again to verify the changes work

# Create documentation and share
> create documentation for the changes I just made
> create a PR with a detailed description of these changes
```

## Advanced Features

Claude Code can be used for:

1. **Modernizing legacy codebases**
2. **Automated code reviews**
3. **Building custom library assistants**
4. **Self-improvement loops**
5. **Dynamic exploration of codebases**
6. **Multi-stage planning for complex tasks**

## Building with Claude Code

Claude Code serves as a building block for AI Native software development, enabling:

- **Library as a Service (LaaS)** implementations
- **AI-friendly documentation systems**
- **Multi-agent development workflows**
